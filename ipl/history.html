<h1>History</h1>
<h3>Inaugural season</h3>
<p>A Chennai vs Kolkata match in progress at the M.A. Chidambaram Cricket Stadium
The tournament started on 18 April 2008 and lasted for 46 days with 59 matches scheduled, out of which 58 took place and 1 was washed out due to rain.The final was played in DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai. Each team played every other both at home and away in a round robin system. The top four ranking sides progressed to the knockout stage of semi-finals followed by a final. Rajasthan Royals emerged as the inaugural IPL champions mainly because of Yusuf Pathan, an unusually big hitter of the ball.
</p>
<h3>Second season</h3>
<p>
The 2009 season coincided with the general elections in India. Due to concerns regarding players' security, the venue was shifted to South Africa. The format of the tournament remained the same as the inaugural one. Deccan Chargers came out as eventual winners of the tournament.
</p>
<h3>Third season</h3>
<p>
The third season opened in January 2010 with the auction for players. 66 players were on offer but only 11 players were sold.[8] No player from Pakistan was selected,[9] leading to an international political row, with Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik suggesting that the Pakistani players had been insulted.[10] Indian External Affairs minister SM Krishna clarified that "The government has nothing to do with the selection of players for sporting events."In this season, defending Champions Deccan Chargers will not play at their preferred home location of Hyderabad or Visakhapatnam due to the ongoing political crisis in the region. The new bases for the champions this season are to be Nagpur, Navi Mumbai and Cuttack.</p>

<h3>Fourth season</h3>
<p>
On March 21st 2010 it was announced that 2 new teams from Pune and Kochi will be added to the IPL from next season. This will increase the number of franchises from 8 to 10 and the number of matches from 60 to 94.</p>
